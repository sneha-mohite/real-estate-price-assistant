      "Assistant: The predicted price of $457,000 for this 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house built in 2015 is notably below Austin's median home price of $650,000. While its 1800 sqft size is slightly smaller than the city's median, this estimate at approximately $254/sqft is significantly less than Austin's average of $438/sqft. This suggests the property might be located in a more value-oriented segment of the Austin market, or its specific features lead to a lower valuation despite its relatively new construction.\n",

Although the property is significantly larger than the median home size in Phoenix, the estimate is lower than the city's median price, suggesting the model might be accounting for factors like its specific condition, age, or a neighborhood-specific price per square foot that differs from the overall city average.\n"

This estimate may be influenced by the unit's smaller size compared to the median, and potentially assumes an older building or less premium location within Miami, given the lack of detail on factors like bathrooms or built year. Additionally, condo pricing can vary greatly from general market averages which may include other property types.\n"
